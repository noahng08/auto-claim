# Auto Claim Severity Prediction - ASNA Hackathon Winner Solution

The hackathon challenged us to build ML models to predict auto insurance claims exceeding $1,000 and translate these insights into actionable business decisions for the insurance industry.

After advancing through the initial rounds, our team was among the top 3 teams invited to present our findings at the in-person ASNA convention. We focused on making our approach relatable to a non-technical audience, covering everything from feature engineering and model structure to how ML metrics can inform key performance indicators in insurance. We were then announced as the ASNA Hackathon Winner!
